# The Support Request Application

Managing requests that flow into your email inbox can be difficult at a high volume; project requirments or important events can be lost or forgotten as the emails pile up. This project was designed to create an environment in which co-workers and collaborators could request support, organize project requirements, and complete tasks together in a visual manner, wihtout having to manage their tasks and projects via hundreds of emails in their inbox.
